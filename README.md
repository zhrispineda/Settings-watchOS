SwiftUI recreation of the watchOS Settings app.

## Information
- This personal project is a recreation of Apple's current and default Settings app for Apple Watch **(Simulator.app)** on watchOS 10.4 (21T5196c).
- All features within the app are only simulations and have no effect on the device outside of the app.
- Most views are complete, but lack features such as saving data, including basic variables, perhaps for now.
- Since this is based off of the Simulator and not a physical Apple Watch, perhaps for now, aspects such as simulated controls and views for radios, are unavailable at this time.

## Usage
Open the project in Xcode and run with either a Simulator running Apple Watch's watchOS or a physical Apple Watch with Developer Mode enabled as a destination.

As this is a personal project for learning Swift and SwiftUI, feel free to fork, explore, and make the project your own for any personal purpose!

## Contributing
Contributions such as pull requests that help make the app more accurate and better optimized are always welcome.

Issues are also encouraged to raise awareness to certain issues, inconsistencies, or questions about the project.

## To Do
- Make use of NSUserDefaults for saving and loading basic data
- Make use of Bindings and a Model to keep persistent data across views and app sessions
- Implement simulated functionality and views for radios and other physical-device-only views

## Disclaimers
- This app is a recreation of one of Apple's own apps and its designs.
- All assets such as icons including those of Apple's and the Bluetooth symbol are not my own in any way.
- Feel free to look through the commit history to see the project evolve from a single view to its current state.
- Some code may not be best practice and may not be optimal.
