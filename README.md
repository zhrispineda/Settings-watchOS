# Settings-watchOS
A **work-in-progress** SwiftUI recreation of the watchOS Settings app.

## Information
- This personal project is a recreation of Apple's current and default Settings app for Apple Watch **(Simulator.app)** on watchOS 11.2 **Release** (22S101).
- All features within the app are only simulations and have no effect on the device outside of the app.
- This is based off of the Simulator and not a physical Apple Watch for now; aspects such as simulated controls and views for radios are unavailable at this time.

## Examples
Apple's watchOS Settings app is shown first, followed up by this project's app, as shown in the GIF below:

## Usage
Open the project in Xcode and run with either a Simulator running watchOS or a physical Apple Watch with Developer Mode enabled as a destination.

As this is a personal project for learning Swift and SwiftUI, feel free to fork, explore, and make the project your own for any personal use!

## Disclaimers
- This app is a recreation of one of Apple's own apps and designs.
- All assets such as icons and images are not my own in any way.
- Feel free to look through the commit history to see the project evolve from a single view to its current state.
