## Information
- This personal project is a recreation of Apple's current and default Settings app for Apple Watch **(Simulator.app)** on watchOS 11.0 (22R5284o).
- All features within the app are only simulations and have no effect on the device outside of the app.
- Most views are complete, but lack features such as saving/retrieving data, for now.
- Since this is based off of the Simulator and not a physical Apple Watch for now; aspects such as simulated controls and views for radios are unavailable at this time.

## Usage
Open the project in Xcode and run with either a Simulator running Apple Watch's watchOS or a physical Apple Watch with Developer Mode enabled as a destination.

As this is a personal project for learning Swift and SwiftUI, feel free to fork, explore, and make the project your own for any personal purpose!

## To Do
- Complete missing views.

## Disclaimers
- This app is a recreation of one of Apple's own apps and its designs.
- All assets such as icons and images are not my own in any way.
- Feel free to look through the commit history to see the project evolve from a single view to its current state.
