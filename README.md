# Settings-watchOS
A **work-in-progress** SwiftUI recreation of the watchOS Settings app.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> This project is currently focused on watchOS 26 beta using Xcode 26 beta. Use an older branch to deploy this project on watchOS 11.5/Xcode 16.4 or earlier.

## Information
- This project is a recreation of Apple's Settings app for Apple Watch **(Simulator)** on watchOS 26 **beta 7** (23R5346a).
- All features within the app are only simulations and have no effect on the device outside of the app.
- This is based off of the Simulator and not a physical Apple Watch for now.

## Examples
Apple's Settings app is opened first, followed up by this project's app:

## Usage
Open the project in Xcode and run with either a watchOS Simulator or a physical Apple Watch with Developer Mode enabled as a destination.

Feel free to fork, explore, and make the project your own for any personal use!

## Disclaimers
- This app is a recreation of one of Apple's own apps and designs.
- All assets such as icons and images are not my own in any way.
- Feel free to look through the commit history to see the project evolve from a single view to its current state.
